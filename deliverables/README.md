##Week 2: Introduction to Ruby
###Intro to the Back End
####Required
What is the difference between front- and back-end development?  
As the name states “Front-End” is the part of the code that is on the front of the application. It is usually visible to user in the form of an interface inviting to interact with user. The main purpose of the front-end code is to interact with user, as well as present the data in a well-defined style and matter. The back-end development is a part of the application that is never visible to the user. It is built with use of server-side language and database. Front-end code interacts with a user in real time while back-end code interacts with a server to return user ready results. Anything displayed on the website is because of the query performed on the server returned data to the front-end.<br>

Why do you need to install Ruby but not HTML/CSS?  
We need RUby becasue it is the programing language that tells our website what to do. It is the interpretive language that truly controls the website. where HTML/CSS is more of the skelton of the wesite, which just shows whats on each page so it is the design adn lay out of the site.     

Read the [intro to back end on the Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/introduction-to-the-back-end) description, and the [What is: Back-end web development](http://blog.generalassemb.ly/what-is-back-end-web-development/) blog post.

###Intro to Ruby
####Required

What is an "interpreted" language?  
It is a programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. The interpreter executes the program directly, translating each statement into a sequence of one or more subroutines already compiled into machine code.<br>

What is IRB?  
Interactive Ruby Shell (IRB or irb) is a REPL for programming in the object-oriented scripting language Ruby. The abbreviation irb comes from the fact that the filename extension for Ruby is ".rb", although interactive Ruby files do not have an extension of ".irb".<br>

What are Objects?  
Most everything in Ruby is an Object. All objects have an identity; they can also hold state and manifest behaviour by responding to messages. <br>  

What are Methods?  
They are very similar to functions in any other programming language. Ruby methods are used to bundle one or more repeatable statements into a single unit. Method names should begin with a lowercase letter. If you begin a method name with an uppercase letter, Ruby might think that it is a constant and hence can parse the call incorrectly. <br>

What are Classes?    
A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created. It is also an object-oriented term.<br>

What are Blocks?  
A block consists of chunks of code which You assign a name to, The code in the block is always enclosed within braces ({}).and they are always invoked from a function with the same name as that of the block. You invoke a block by using the yield statement.<br>

What is an Array?  
They are simple lists, they store their information in a sequence.<br>

What is an Iterator?    
Iterators are nothing but methods supported by collections, return all the elements of a collection, one after the other. <br>

What are hashes?    
A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs and the indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index.<br>

What is a library?    
The main place where libraries are hosted is RubyGems.org, providing Ruby libs as gems.<br>

What is a gem?  
A gem is a  a self-contained format That can be distributed by RubyGems.

###Weekly Project
You need to complete all the problems on the RubyMonk ([starting with this one](http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer/problems/9-calculator)) and upload them to your deliverables Github Repo in the RubyMonk folder. If you get stuck, refer to the GitHub information in the [Odin project’s walkthrough](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css).

Put each problem solution into the appropriate file in `ruby_monk_problems`
