##Week 2: Introduction to Ruby
###Intro to the Back End
####Required
What is the difference between front- and back-end development?  
As the name states “Front-End” is the part of the code that is on the front of the application. It is usually visible to user in the form of an interface inviting to interact with user. The main purpose of the front-end code is to interact with user, as well as present the data in a well-defined style and matter. The back-end development is a part of the application that is never visible to the user. It is built with use of server-side language and database. Front-end code interacts with a user in real time while back-end code interacts with a server to return user ready results. Anything displayed on the website is because of the query performed on the server returned data to the front-end.<br>

Why do you need to install Ruby but not HTML/CSS?  
We need RUby becasue it is the programing language that tells our website what to do. It is the interpretive language that truly controls the website. where HTML/CSS is more of the skelton of the wesite, which just shows whats on each page so it is the design adn lay out of the site.     

Read the [intro to back end on the Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/introduction-to-the-back-end) description, and the [What is: Back-end web development](http://blog.generalassemb.ly/what-is-back-end-web-development/) blog post.

What is an "interpreted" language?  
It is a programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. The interpreter executes the program directly, translating each statement into a sequence of one or more subroutines already compiled into machine code.<br>

What is IRB?  
Interactive Ruby Shell (IRB or irb) is a REPL for programming in the object-oriented scripting language Ruby. The abbreviation irb comes from the fact that the filename extension for Ruby is ".rb", although interactive Ruby files do not have an extension of ".irb".<br>

What are Objects?  
Most everything in Ruby is an Object. All objects have an identity; they can also hold state and manifest behaviour by responding to messages. <br>  

What are Methods?  
<br>
What are Classes?<br>
What are Blocks?<br>
What is an Array?  
They are simple lists, they store their information in a sequence.<br>

What is an Iterator?  
<br>
What are hashes?<br>
What is a library?<br>
What is a gem?

Do the RubyMonk “Ruby Primer” course: http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1

###Weekly Project
You need to complete all the problems on the RubyMonk ([starting with this one](http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer/problems/9-calculator)) and upload them to your deliverables Github Repo in the RubyMonk folder. If you get stuck, refer to the GitHub information in the [Odin project’s walkthrough](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css).

Put each problem solution into the appropriate file in `ruby_monk_problems`

####Optional & Resources
 - Read and complete the [Ruby in 100 minutes guide](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby\_in\_100_minutes.html)
 - [Ruby beginners guide](https://hackhands.com/beginners-guide-ruby/)
 - Do the first Ruby exercise (Bob) on [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) and respond to any
   feedback you receieve.  Provide a link to your submission on
